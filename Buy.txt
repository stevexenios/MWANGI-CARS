<h1><i class="fa fa-car">BUSINESS</i></h1>
<p class="groove">Our business model is driven by one ideal; that is to provide affordable means of transportation. 
By affordable, we mean that when our customers get into a financial or circumstancial difficulty that
prevents them from using  their own vehicle, we can provide a cheap means of transportation. We also
provide jobs for hard working individuals with an entrepreneurial spirit who also want to improve the
society around them.</p>

<h1><i class="fa fa-car">MISSION</i></h1>
<p class="groove">Our main mission is to povide reliable, cheap and on-demand means of transportation for all. 
We do not aim to be like Uber and Lyft, nor are we aiming to capitalize on the
business model of companies like enterprise or budget; we merely want to cater to the small niche
of individuals who are sometimes compelled to find an alternative means of transportation.
Think of us as that altertanative, but cheaper! WAY CHEAPER.</p>

<h1><i class="fa fa-car">VISION</i></h1>
<p class="groove">Cater to the needs of our society and help improve the standard of living of each individual in it.</p>
